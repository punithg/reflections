1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--whenever we initialize a git repository then a .git directory is created in which all our history is tracked.
To which we keep on adding commits to keep track of our project

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--staging area is an area which has the files which are to be tracked whenever a git commit is created. Working directory is the directory
which has the .git file and the git repository is the area which contains all the history of the tracked files.

3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
--by adding only one file in the staging area, the file which has been changed in the staging area we can make sure
to have only one commit per logical change.

4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
--Branches would be helpful if we are creating or performing some very risky changes in the source code.so that we can keep the other branch sorcecode 
working.or if we are not planning any official release and just wanted to work on the previous release and want to keep a working version to show our friends.

5)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
--Diagrams help me visualize the branch structure as they are in the git repository.

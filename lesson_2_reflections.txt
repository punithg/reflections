1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--whenever we initialize a git repository then a .git directory is created in which all our history is tracked.
To which we keep on adding commits to keep track of our project

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--staging area is an area which has the files which are to be tracked whenever a git commit is created. Working directory is the directory
which has the .git file and the git repository is the area which contains all the history of the tracked files.

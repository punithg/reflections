1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--In situations like we do not have our local system wit us or if we are working in some other place.This could help a lot.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--Because pullin changes manually would keep our local repository the way it is wanted by the user.Because the remote can be updated by any other user online
and that change may or maynot be needed by tht current user.hence updating the local repository manually is a good option.

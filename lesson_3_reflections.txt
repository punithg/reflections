1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--In situations like we do not have our local system wit us or if we are working in some other place.This could help a lot.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--Because pullin changes manually would keep our local repository the way it is wanted by the user.Because the remote can be updated by any other user online
and that change may or maynot be needed by tht current user.hence updating the local repository manually is a good option.

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--forks are the copied repositories from others in github, clones are the copy of the github repositories into local systems. and the branches rae the different
branch created while creating a commit history to maintain our original application y be working in master branch.
forks are used to copy a whole repository from others to our own github account.clones are used to copy frm github to local syatems.

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--having a copy of last known sate of te remote locally would help us in comparing our local drectory and the remote even when e dont have an internet access.

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
--i would collaborate without using github by contacting the othe person but the commit jobs done here does not match any other type of collaboration,
so in this modern world if we are to create big projects then using git and github is the best option i guess.

6)When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
--whenever we wanted to work with  a new featrure or some new code which we do not want to collaborate with other people and not show them until it is complete
then we canc reate a new branch in which we can keep our work personal and create a pull request whenever we ant to merge that code eith the master branch.
